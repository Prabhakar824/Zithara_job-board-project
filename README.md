Project Overview

This is a simple Job Board Platform built using Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL. It allows users to view job listings, add new jobs, and view job details.

1.What’s Working?

-> Homepage displaying job listings with a clean UI

-> Job details page for viewing specific job information

-> Form to add new jobs

-> Basic navigation using a responsive navbar

-> Zustand for state management

2.What’s Missing?

-> Database Integration: Currently using a temporary state store instead of a persistent database.

-> Authentication: No user authentication is implemented.

-> Error Handling: Limited error handling in form submissions.

-> Deployment: Not deployed yet.

3.Future Enhancements (If More Time Available)

-> Connect to a MySQL database for permanent storage.

-> Add authentication for secure access.

-> Implement job filtering and search functionality.

-> Deploy using platforms like Vercel.
